## Introduction
How can we make art using code? In this module, we explore together techniques needed to draw and control pixels on screen. We will use libraries such as p5js, a popular library for creating graphics in a browser. Together, we will tour the basics of the JavaScript language including functions, data structures and conditional statements and objects to draw graphics and images screen. From there, we will look more advanced techniques such as image processing, video, sound, text manipulation, mathematical animation, and data visualisation using data from files and online sources like the public APIs.

---

## Learning Outcomes
On completion of this unit you will be able to:

+ Demonstrate a basic awareness of the JavaScript language to create online interactive applications (Technical Competence)
+ Exhibit fluency in fundamentals of computationally driven video, image and sound processing (Technical Competence)
+ Identify and research creative computational problems to arrive at solutions working independently (Research)
+ Experiment with a variety of visual algorithmic techniques to create original art work (Experimentation)

---

## Creative Project Brief
Create a portfolio of **three** programs with a cohesive design language or theme.
 
Your final portfolio must consist of any three of the following:

+ A simple video game;
+ A program controlling video playback and basic video filters;
+ Animation using polar coordinate systems;  
+ Simple patterns found in nature such as oscillation and waves; 
+ A data visualisation integrating public APIs.

---

## Assessment Type

**Coursework 100%, consisting of:**  
**Class Participation - 10%:**

+ Engagement in class activities, evidenced by asking and answering insightful questions.

**Process Log- 10%:**

+ Weekly documentation of class reflections, research process, and experimentations.
+ You should upload your weekly class assignments on this blog.
+ Include your hand-drawn sketches, videos, images, texts, or any material that you are referring to.

**Research Presentation - 20%:**

+ 5-7 minute student presentations on an artist, collective, movement, or design philosophy that mixes computation and art.

**Portfolio - 60%:**

+ A collection of original art works containing three p5.js sketches in the formats mentioned in the project brief.
+ 250-300 words synopsis describing and contextualising your portfolio. 
+ An annotated bibliography with 3 - 5 academic references.

---

### Guidelines:
**Class Participation**:

+ There are no wrong or right answers in class discussions. 
+ Prepare for each class by completing your core readings.
+ A good way to engage with reading materials is to create three open-ended questions that you can ask in class.
+ We will collectively create rules of engagement for participation in the first session of this module. We will respect these rules for the course of the module.
+ Each workshop begins and ends with discussions of our creative work. Give constructive feedback. Be generous with your information. Is there something you would do differently? Why and how?

**Process Log:**

+ You should log your development and production process in a blog hosted on GitHub Pages, WordPress, Wix, or Tumblr. Use the best method suited to your workflow.  
+ It is important that you document your assignments, challenges you faced in making your code work and how you resolved them.  
+ Highlight when you are addressing subjects discussed in class, projects that inspire you, your experimentations and research through tags. These can be \#inspiration, \#research, \#challenges, or \#assignments.
+ This is your space to reflect and express yourself. It is your digital sketchbook. Decorate your blog however you choose, use an informal tone, scan your drawings, use memes --- so far as the content is intelligible, organised, and shows critical engagement with content of the module.

**Research Presentation**:

+ Contextualise the chosen subject, within the proper historical, political, cultural, and artistic environment.
+ Illustrate with videos, images, and text, the key pieces in the subject's portfolio.
+ Highlight the tools, processes and motivations of the subject.
+ Expand on how or why this subject speaks to you.
+ Bring 2-3 questions from your research that we can discuss in the seminar.
+ Submit your presentation as a PDF of your slides.   
[Refer to this list of Women in New Media Art if you do not know where to start your search for artists](http://cmuems.com/2016/60212/resources/some-women-in-new-media/).  
You can also choose an artist that fits the theme of the seminar.

**Portfolio:**

+ Your final portfolio must have a cohesive design language/aesthetic, inspiration or theme that you have researched and critically reflected on.
+ Your project files must be submitted as an Open Processing profile.
+ Evidence of your critical engagement should be demonstrated in a 250-300 words "README" file that:
  - introduces your portfolio;
  - outlines the format of your sketches (ie. game, data visualization, pattern in nature... etc);
  - explains your themes and motivations;
+ Evidence of appropriate research should be demonstrated in the 3-5 academic sources in your [annotated bibliography](https://library.leeds.ac.uk/info/1401/academic_skills/80/annotated_bibliographies).
  - Each source must be summarized, explaining its connection to your theme.
  - Summaries should be between 200-250 words for each reference.
  - Your citations must use the Harvard author-date style. [See the library guide for more on academic referencing.](https://arts.ac.libguides.com/referencing)
+ Your portfolio submission must have a title. Place this as the first heading of your "README" file.
